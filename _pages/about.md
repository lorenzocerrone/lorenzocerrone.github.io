Hello there! I'm Lorenzo, a scientific software developer focused on applying Deep Learning to biomedical computer vision challenges! 

I was lucky enough to work on a variety of projects at the intersection of computer vision and biomedical research. To name some, I developed deep learning pipelines, for instance segmentation using convolutional neural networks, cell detection and tracking using transformers, assembling large-scale datasets for bio-medical computer vision applications, generative models for synthetic training data generation, and cell/tissue classification using graph neural networks.

Since 2019, I've been developing PlantSeg, a cutting-edge software designed for the segmentation of plant tissues from confocal and light-sheet microscopy data.

Something more about me? I like dogs, photography, and riding mountain bikes.
